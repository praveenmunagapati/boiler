Various scripts here. Some of them:

* anb: list lines in file A missing in file B (anb is short for "a not b")
* fcut: print region of a file (given a byte position and length) 
* setup: configure some of my preferences for bash, git, gdb, etc
* bin2hex: read stdin, print as hex 
* hex2bin: take hex, emit as binary 
* tally: read numbers from stdin or file argument, print their sum
